# HeuristicLib

"A modern, reimagined library for heuristic and evolutionary algorithms"

This is the spiritual successor to [HeuristicLab](https://github.com/heal-research/HeuristicLab):

- **Library first**: Focus on a well-designed API that is intuitive to use.
- **Focused scope**: Does less, but does it well.
- **Modern C#**: Built with the latest C# features.
- **Open**: Be usable from other ecosystems like Python. 

Noticeable differences to HeuristicLab:
- No GUI
  - HeuristicLib focuses on being a library first. 
- No operator graph
  - Write algorithms in plain C# code.
- No serialization
  - Only key datastructures (e.g., algorithm configurations or solutions) are serializable.
